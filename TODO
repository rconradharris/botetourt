Different kinds of maps needed:

Move map - legal moves a piece can make

Attack map - which squares a piece is currently attacking

A player is attacking a square if he has a piece on that square, or one of his
pieces is attacking that square.

A king can capture a piece only if it is unprotected.

How do we determine if it's protected?


- determine which opposing pieces are attacking a given square?
