Rules
=====

- Need a test for double check


How to determine if a piece can interpose between king and attacking piece?
    - NOTE: Only rook, bishop and queen can be interposed upon

    - Determine the pieces attacking the king
    - Determine the squares in between attacking pieces and king
        - Could have a concept of attack_vectors
            get_attack_vectors() returns a set of all attack vectors for a piece

    - Determine if any of our pieces have a legal move that occupies one of
      those in-between squares

Cleanup
=======

- Add test for set_piece if piece is already present
